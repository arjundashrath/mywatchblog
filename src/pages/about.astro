	<p>
		Hey there! I'm Arjun, the person behind <strong
			>The Wrist Journal</strong
		>, and I'm glad you found your way here.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog started from a simple belief: <strong
			>Watch collection is still a niche hobby in India and we want to
			change that.</strong
		>
		Whether it's a reliable Casio beater, a Seiko that punches way above its
		price, or a microbrand gem that nobody's talking about yet — there are incredible
		timepieces at every budget, that you can find in India.
	</p>

	<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

	<p>
		I write about watches under all budget. Expect honest reviews, buying
		guides, comparisons, and the occasional deep-dive into what makes a
		watch tick — literally.
	</p>

	<p>
		I want this blog to be the place where newcomers feel welcome and
		seasoned collectors discover their next under-the-radar favorite.
	</p>

	<h2>Get in Touch</h2>

	<p>
		Have a watch you think I should check out? Want to share your own
		collection? I'd love to hear from you. Drop me a line at <a
			href="mailto:arjundashrath@gmail.com">arjundashrath@gmail.com</a
		> and let's talk watches.
